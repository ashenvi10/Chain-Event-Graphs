The code here was developed as part of my PhD project.
• It takes a dataframe and creates an event tree, staged tree and a Chain Event Graph (CEG).
• You can add paths corresponding to sampling zeros.
• It uses the Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) algorithm with a Bayes factor score for model selection.
• The algorithm it uses to transform a staged tree into a CEG has been reported in a paper which has just been submitted to a conference.
